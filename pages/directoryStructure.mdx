# Organizing your directory structure
In this section, I'll share my thoughts on a good directory structure for your system, which can help keep your files organized and easy to find.
Here's what I think is a good directory structure (for a dev):

```bash
C:/
├── Tools/
│   └── Flutter
└── Users/
    └── User/
        ├── Dev/
        │   ├── School/
        │   │   ├── Git
        │   │   ├── Python
        │   │   └── Flutter
        │   ├── Playground
        │   └── [Projects...]
        ├── Documents/
        │   ├── School/
        │   └── Personal/
        │       └── Administrative documents
        ├── Downloads
        └── OneDrive
```

_This tree was made using [tree.nathanfriend.io](https://tree.nathanfriend.io/)_.

### Icons
To make your directory structure more visually appealing and easier to navigate, consider using custom icons. 
Here's an example of the icons I use:

![](/images/favbar.png)

Finally, if you'd like to declutter your taskbar, right-click on it and disable the "Show network" option.
