## Download Windows Media Creation Tool
To install Windows 11, you will need to download the official [Windows media creation tools](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11/) from Microsoft. 
This tool will help you create a bootable USB drive for the installation process.

You can download the tool directly from the Microsoft website and follow the instructions to create a bootable drive.

## Boot from the USB drive
Once you have created a bootable USB drive, you will need to boot your computer from it. 
For this, restart your computer and press the boot menu key (usually F12 or F2) to select the boot device.

## Start the installation process
After you have successfully booted from the USB drive, the installation process will begin. 
Go to the next step to learn the installation process.
