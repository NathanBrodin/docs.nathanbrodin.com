# Installation

Follow the steps until you reach the "Sign in" page.

## Naming your device
When naming your device, I recommand you to name it *Laptop* because it looks cool in the terminal.

## Adding your Microsoft account
I recommand you to use a local account instead of a Microsoft account.
For this, when you reach the "Sign in" page, click on "Sign-in-options" and then click on " Offline account".

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    <strong>If this option is not available:</strong> <br />
    Sign in with a random email address: a@a.com <br />
    And a random password: random

    Then click next, you should now be able to click on "Offline account".

### Microsoft spying
During the setup process, make sure to refuse all data collection options to protect your privacy.

## Update
Once you are done, go to the "Settings/Windows Update" and check for updates.

Install every pilots to keep the laptop up to date.
For my laptop: [Huawei pilots page](https://consumer.huawei.com/fr/support/laptops/matebook-d-15-amd/).

<Callout>
  Reboot your device to apply the updates and drivers.
