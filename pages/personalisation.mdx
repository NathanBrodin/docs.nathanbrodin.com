# Personalization and Aesthetics
Hey there! In this page, we'll dive into personalizing your Windows 11 system to create an environment that's both visually appealing and efficient. We'll cover dark mode, desktop organization, wallpaper, clock, and taskbar customization.

First, let's switch to dark mode. Head to your system settings and enable dark mode for a more comfortable viewing experience. While you're at it, clear your desktop by removing all icons.

## Wallpaper
For a stylish wallpaper, check out [this repository](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers/blob/master/wallpaper-preview.md) featuring beautiful Nordic-style wallpapers.

## Clock
Upgrade your clock display by installing [Rainmetter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) and this sleek [clock skin](https://www.deviantart.com/starlender/art/Simple-Clock-Rainmeter-Skin-UPDATED-788193436). Make sure to follow the setup guide to configure the weather location correctly.
For this, go to "C:\Users\Default\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Simple Clock 2.0\@Resources\variables.inc" and add [your openweather API keys](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Taskbar
Let's tidy up your taskbar. Keep only essential apps (like File Explorer, web browser, VSCode, Illustrator, and InDesign). Less is more! Remove any extra icons to declutter your view.

Lastly, enhance your taskbar's appearance by installing [TranslucentTB](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB) and setting it to acrylic mode.
