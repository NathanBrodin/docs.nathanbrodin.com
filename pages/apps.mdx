# Essential apps
In this section, I'll share my experience with essential apps that I've installed and configured on my Windows 11 system.

## Brave Browser
After installing [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), disabled the password manager under _/Autofill_ and set the shield to Aggressive for better privacy.

<Callout>
  I plan to switch from Brave to [Arc](https://arc.net) when it becomes available on Windows.

## Password manager
I currently use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) as my password manager.

<Callout type="info">
    I intend to switch from Bitwarden to [Uno](https://uno.app/) once it's available on Windows.

## Microsoft 365
First, unistall all Microsoft apps. 
Then, reinstalled them again using [this link](https://www.office.com/?auth=2&home=1).

## Winget
It's a package manager for Windows, you can install it via the Microsoft Store.

## PowerToys
I also recommand installing PowerToys to acces some usefull features.
The one I use is the `Past As Plain Text` that I activate with `Ctrl+Alt+V`.

You can install it via this command:
```bash
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys --source winget
```
