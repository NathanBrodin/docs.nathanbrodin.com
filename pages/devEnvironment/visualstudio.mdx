## Activate Auto Save
To ensure your work is automatically saved, enable the auto-save feature in Visual Studio Code. Follow these steps:

1.Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on "File" in the menu bar.
3. Click on "Auto Save" to enable it.


## Extensions
I installed the following extensions to enhance my Visual Studio Code experience:

- Markdown Preview Github Styling
- GitHub Copilot
- GitLens
- Headwind
- Python Extensions Pack
- Material Theme Icons
- One Dark Pro
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
