# Installing Development Tools
On this page, we'll discuss setting up development tools on your Windows 11 system. While I'll be focusing on installing the Flutter SDK, feel free to add any other tools that you find helpful for your projects.

To begin with Flutter, follow [this guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows) for a smooth installation process on Windows.

Remember, you can always customize your development environment by adding more tools according to your needs and preferences. Happy coding!
