# Setting Up Git and GitHub CLI
In this section, I'll share my experience in setting up Git and GitHub CLI on my Windows 11 system.

## Install Git
To get started with Git, download and install it from the official [Git Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

## Install GitHub CLI
To access GitHub from PowerShell, I installed GitHub CLI. Here's how you can do it:

1. Visit the GitHub [CLI official download page](https://cli.github.com/).
2. Download the installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

Once both Git and GitHub CLI are installed, you'll be able to use Git and manage your GitHub repositories directly from your PowerShell.
