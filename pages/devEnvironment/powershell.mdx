# Customizing Powershell
In this section, I'll share my experience in customizing PowerShell, including changing the color scheme, opacity, and adding keyboard shortcuts.

## Visual Customization
To customize the appearance of PowerShell, I set the following options:

- colorScheme: "One Half Dark"
- opacity: 80
- acrylic: True

## Oh My Posh
To further enhance my PowerShell experience, I installed [Oh my posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) both on PowerShell and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Keyboard Shortcut 
To quickly access PowerShell, I added a keyboard shortcut. I assigned the F3 key to open PowerShell. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the PowerShell shortcut icon.
2. Click on "Properties."
3. In the "Shortcut" tab, click on the "Shortcut key" field.
4. Press the F3 key (or any other key you'd prefer to use).
5. Click "Apply" and then "OK."

Now, you can easily open PowerShell using the F3 key.
