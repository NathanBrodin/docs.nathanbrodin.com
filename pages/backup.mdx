# Setting Up Backup and Restore
In this final section, I'll share my experience in setting up the Backup and Restore feature in Windows 11.

## Access Backup and Restore
To access the Backup and Restore feature, follow these steps:

1. Press the _Win + S_ keys to open the Windows Search.
2. Type "Control Panel" and press Enter.
3. In the Control Panel, click on "System and Security."
4. Click on "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)."
From here, you can set up a backup plan to ensure your important files are safely stored in case of system issues or data loss. You can also restore files from previous backups.

By setting up a backup plan, you'll have peace of mind knowing that your important data is protected.
